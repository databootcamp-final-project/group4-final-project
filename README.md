## Project Proposal

For our final project, we will build an application to analyze and predict the future price of stocks by modeling a couple of company indexes as the model for our ML. 

We will be looking at the opening, closing, lowest and highest price of a few indexes (companies), split, train and test their data to come up with a working model and successful prediction.

We will use the following tools : 

Data cleaning : Pandas

Visualizations : HTML, CSS, Tableau

Database : Postgres

Machine Learning: GridSearchCV, Linear Regression, TensorFlow

Deployment : Heroku

## Creating the training dataset

Our ultimate goal for the training data is to have a 'snapshot' of a particular stock at a particular time, and its performance of a determined period of time.
